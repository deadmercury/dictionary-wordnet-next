Todo-

1. add jsdoc
2. add prefers-color-theme in themecontext
3. fixed navbar on keyboard on mobile
4. add wordnet license to settings page
5. add icon gloss of definition symbols to settings page
6. scroll restoration

styled-jsx is limited and makes systems hard to understand
encourages you to write in components
works when abstracted to components but the same markup expanded does not work
no offense but node-wordnet is not particularly a good api
